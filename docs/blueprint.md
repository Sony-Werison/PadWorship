# **App Name**: Pad Worship

## Core Features:

- Synth Pad Generation: Generate continuous synth pad sounds based on selected notes and presets.

- Preset Selection: Select from a range of synth presets to quickly change the timbre of the generated pad.
- Sample Configuration: Allow users to input Google Drive file IDs for each note to use custom samples.
- Motion Control: Control the intensity of filter motion in the synth pads using a slider.
- Ambience Control: Adjust the stereo movement (auto-pan) speed for synth pads using a slider to control the ambience.
- Audio file availability assistant: When configured to use Google Drive, have the LLM proactively look at all files linked. Have it confirm that the links provided by the user appear to be working, so the user knows to correct problems immediately.
